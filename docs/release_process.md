# Release Process (v1.0.0)

## Version

> **The `[semantic version]` is bumped according to releases, new features, and breaking changes.**
>
> *The `main` branch uses the semantic version of the last released version.

## Process

**Note**: this guide assumes that the your git `torrust` remote is like this:

```sh
git remote show torrust
```

```s
* remote torrust
  Fetch URL: git@github.com:torrust/torrust-index-types-lib.git
  Push  URL: git@github.com:torrust/torrust-index-types-lib.git
...
```

### 1. The `main` branch is ready for a release

```sh
npm install && npm run build
```

There should be no errors installing or building the library.

### 2. Change the version in the `package.json` file

Change the version in the `package.json` file. For example `3.0.0`.

> NOTICE: The `v` prefix is not needed.

Install and build to double-check:

```sh
npm install && npm run build
```

Commit the changes:

```sh
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: release [semantic version]"
```

### 3. Create a new tag an push to the remote

```sh
git tag v[semantic version]
git push torrust && git push torrust v[semantic version]
```

For example:

```sh
git tag v3.0.0
git push torrust && git push torrust v3.0.0
```

### 4. Manually publish the NPM package

```sh
npm publish
```
